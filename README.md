# C Programming Dumps

- This serves as my dumpsite of C files, as a Bachelor of Information Technology student in University of San Carlos, Cebu. ~~I lost some of my Programming I files, so that's the unfortunate side of it (maybe I'm too lazy to recreate them. sorry).Hence, I  dedicate this repo for those who wish to review Programming II files or maybe get a sneak peek of DSA.~~

- I found some of my Programming I files. Yey! So this will be dedicated for those taking Programming I, II, and DSA.

- The source files of this repository was made with <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">Visual Studio Code</a> as the main text editor. Make the necessary changes if you use varying IDEs. It is recommended to use <a href="https://www.embarcadero.com/free-tools/dev-cpp">Dev-C++</a> for this case.

- **DISCLAIMER: In no way will I dump answer files here. Please don't even ask for one here!**

- **NOTE: If the `.gitignore` file is not included in your clone of this repo, please follow the code I wrote for it here!** 

## Topics I dump here:

- **Data Structures and Algorithms (Ongoing)**
- Structures
- Linked-List and Variations
- Arrays ADT List and their Versions **(Some are missing)**

## DSA Topics that I am still working on...

- Functions for ADT such as `insert` `delete` `search` `isMember`
- Cursor-based Implementations
- Bitwise, Bitvector, Hash Table, UID with Unsorted Sets
